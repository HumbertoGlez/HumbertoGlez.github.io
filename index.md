Hi! My name is Humberto and I've always been passionate about technology. I like programming, making and *playing* videogames, my dream is to work as a game developer and make great games!

I want to feel like I left my mark in the world by developing an App, a videogame, or simply collaborating in any type of system. Being in touch with technology is something that I love and I want to actively participate in the creation of new technology.
For me, it is fundamental to maintain an ethic code that has the following points:
  * Contribute to society and human well-being.
  * Avoid harm to others.
  * Be honest and trustworthy.
  * Give proper credit for intellectual property.
  * Respect the privacy of others.

### Awards / Honors:
  * High Academic Achievement Award (2017)
